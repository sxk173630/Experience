INTRODUCTION
------------
Created a .py to compute the similarity between tweets using the Jaccard Distance metric and clustered tweets using the K-means clustering algorithm.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
Implement the tweet clustering function using the Jaccard Distance metric and K-means
clustering algorithm to cluster redundant/repeated tweets into the same cluster. Remember that
you have to write your own code for K-means clustering. It is acceptable to use external
libraries for data loading and pre-processing only. Python is the preferred language for this
assignment. If you want to use any other language, clearly specify how to compile and run your
code in the README file.

INSTALLATION
------------
File called "main.py" and has the .py for running, along with the cnnhealth.txt.
